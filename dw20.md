## First time Access
Contact Ryan with your username to get added to the allow list.
	
## General access
To save on cost, the server is set to shut down when idle. It will boot up when a request is made to the server. 
There are a few ways to do this, any one of these will work:
1. Add the server to your server list. Open the server list. It will time out until it boots.
2. Try to visit <a href="http://dw20.mcserver.cyou">dw20.mcserver.cyou</a>. It won't find a server.
2. Visit this page.
Then wait a few minutes and the server should be booted.
